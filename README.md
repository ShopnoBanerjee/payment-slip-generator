  I developed a web application for <strong>Hanglaatherium</strong>, a well-known biriyani house in Kolkata. The main objective of this app was to generate payment slips for their employees in PDF format. The app used a CSV file as the input source. Working on this project helped me strengthen my foundations in Python, as the entire backend of the application was built using Python.
